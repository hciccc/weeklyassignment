# Week 4 Assignment

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will be creating a database for a new application to help manage data about students and instructors.

The app will allow instructors to help students better and faster by offering a quick
insight into data like assignment completion and effectiveness of assistance requests.

You will be responsible for writing all of the queries to get data from the database. That means writing a lot of `SELECT` statements, without having to worry about any JavaScript, HTML, or CSS.
